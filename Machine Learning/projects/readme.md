### Projects
> This file contain two projects.
  - **brain_tumor_full_project.py** :- this project based on **brain tumor dataset**.This project is done in classroom for teaching purpose.
  this is slightly simple for better understanding prupose.Accuracy gained in this projects is arround **96.36% by using SVM** (support vector machine).
  
  - **heart_attack.py** :- This file is inside final project folder. This is based on **heart attack dataset**.This project is done by me itself as a final project for marks evaluation and I reached accuracy 83.6 % using **BernoulliNB** algorithum.
  
  
 #### Libraries used in projects.
  1.numpy
  2.pandas
  3.matplotlib
  4.seaborn
  5.sklearn
  6.time
  7.joblib
  
  
#### Some important technique used
  - Data cleaning(using pandas)
  - Data visualization(using saborn,matplotlib)
    > by using heatmap,colobar map,histogrm,box plot
  - conecpt of pipline
  - standardization
  - spot checking
  
  
#### List of important algo used in spot checking approach
